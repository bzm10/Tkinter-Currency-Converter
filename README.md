# Tkinter-Currency-Converter
This is a simple currency converter application built using Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to convert currency from one type to another based on the latest exchange rates obtained from an API.

How it works
1. The user selects the "from" and "to" currencies from the dropdown menus.
2. The user enters the amount to be converted in the "Amount" field.
3. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the app performs the currency conversion using the selected currencies and the entered amount.
4. An API request is made to retrieve the conversion rate from the ExchangeRate API.
5. The conversion result is displayed in the designated area on the app window.
Please note that in order to run this application successfully, you need to ensure that the currencies.csv file and the icon.png file are present in the same directory as the Python script.
